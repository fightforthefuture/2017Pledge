  Authoritarianism is spreading worldwide. Now more than ever, our online data could cause unprecedented harm in the wrong hands.

  **Tell every company on the web:** Technology should spread freedom, not tyranny. We are your users, customers, and employees, calling on you to take an ambitious, but achievable step to keep your technology from doing harm: [secure our conversations, data, and devices](). We stand with [the companies]() who have taken [this pledge]() with us, and we hold [the rest]() accountable, starting with our employers, until they have too.

  <h2>Details/FAQ</h2>

  <p class="question">The Problem.</p>
  <p class="answer">Authoritarian governments are gaining power across the globe, and technology plays a major role in extending their reach. Tech companies are supplying the tools they need to discriminate against groups of people and limit freedoms for their authoritarian ends. If an authoritarian government wanted a registry of everyone affiliated with a certain religious or political group, they could get it from Facebook or some other company. These governments exploit weak links in Internet security and the massive troves of data companies hold on people. They can twist the Internet into something it was never meant to be: a weapon against the public.</p>

  <p class="question">The Solution.</p>
  <p class="answer">We can't stop targeted surveillance, but we *can* stop authoritarian tools like discriminatory registries by building a surveillance-resistant web. We're holding companies to building proven security into every service, site, and technology, while also arming users with these tools. We're already part way there, and what is left to do is within reach.</p>
  <p class="question">The Plan.</p>
  <p class="answer">The goal is to get thousands of the sites & apps we use everyday to pledge to secure our data and get millions of people using secure services. As users, we're demanding companies on the web take these steps and we're also [spreading vetted, secure tools]() to everyone else. As tech employees, we are working inside our companies to help them do the right thing. Together, we'll take online and direct action to shut off mass surveillance channels for any unchecked power, including federal agencies like the NSA.</p>
  <p class="question">The Pledge.</p>
  <p class="answer">Technology companies have a key role to play. They decide how the services they build collect, capture, and share our data. In 2017, companies must commit to building technology that does not put human rights at risk. Here's what we are calling on them to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect our conversations: We use the Internet to communicate everything, from sensitive banking information to working with others. Offer publicly auditable, end-to-end encryption, by default wherever possible, for all private communications.</li>

<li>Protect our data: Data can last forever and harm people in unpredictable ways. The best way to guard against that harm is to not collect or store it. Review your data collection practices, and stop collecting and storing information that isn't necessary for your product or business.</li> 

<li>Protect our devices: if our laptops, phones, and Internet-connected devices get hacked, we can lose everything. When gadget and phone makers betray their customers by failing to update connected devices to guard against evolving security threats, aggressively warn users and potential buyers about them.</li>

<li>Block government overreach: Pledge to fight overly broad, questionable, and illegal efforts to surveil your users, in the courts and in public. Publish transparency reports detailing requests from governments to the greatest extent allowed by law. Prohibit the use of your products and services, especially your APIs, to collect information about your customers and users for governmental surveillance purposes. Companies that sell such information to law enforcement and intelligence agencies should be considered agents of the government.</li>
  </ol>
<p>In the coming weeks, we will be working with Internet users and employees across the tech industry to urge your companies to take this pledge. Over the course of 2017, we will celebrate those companies that have taken these steps and draw public awareness to those that have left us vulnerable. </p>
