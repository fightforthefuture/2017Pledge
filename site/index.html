  Our online data is being used by those who seek to control and exploit us. Now, more than ever, we need the 
  online entities we entrust with our information to keep it safe and to keep us in charge.

  **Tell every company on the web:**  Technology should spread freedom, not tyranny. We are your users, customers, 
  and employees, calling on you to take an ambitious, but achievable steps to keep your technology from doing harm: 
  secure our conversations, data, and devices. We will stand with the companies who take this pledge, and we will 
  hold the rest accountable (including our employers), until they have too.

  <h2>What's happening?</h2>

  <p class="question">The Problem.</p>
  <p class="answer">Corporate and government attacks on human rights to privacy, security, and liberty are 
    increasing across the globe, and technology plays a central role in extending their reach. Technology 
    can empower and grant freedoms to us all, but now our online data is empowering data brokers, ISP’s, 
    surveillance companies, and runaway government agencies to discriminate, exploit, and limit our freedoms. 
    If a company wanted to exploit, or an authoritarian government wanted to surveil everyone affiliated with 
    a certain racial, religious, or political group, they could do so with the information collected on 
    innocent people by technology and social media companies. Companies and governments can exploit the 
    massive troves of data companies have on people and weak links in Internet security. They can twist the 
    Internet into something it was never meant to be: a weapon against the public.</p>

  <p class="question">The Solution.</p>
  <p class="answer">We can stop abuses of our data and authoritarian tools by demanding companies protect our 
    privacy and by building a surveillance-resistant web. We're calling on companies to reaffirm the power of 
    their users and to build proven security into every service, site, and technology. To achieve this, we are 
    arming users with the information they need to make informed choices about what services to use. We're 
    already part-way there, and what is left to do is within reach.
</p>
  <p class="question">The Plan.</p>
  <p class="answer">The goal is to get thousands of the sites & apps we use every day to pledge to secure our 
    data and get millions of people using secure services. As users, we are demanding companies on the web take 
    this pledge and take these steps so that everyone can choose the services that protect their privacy and 
    security. Those of us who are tech employees are pledging to work inside our companies to push them to do 
    the right thing. Together we'll take online and offline action to shut off channels that allow for our 
    exploitation and surveillance, whether it’s Cambridge Analytica or the NSA. Over the course of 2017, we will 
    acknowledge those companies that have taken these steps and draw public awareness to those that have left us 
    vulnerable.
</p>
  <p class="question">The Pledge.</p>
  <p class="answer"> For Internet users who take the pledge: As an Internet user, private information about us 
    and our community ends up in the hands of corporations and governments, with fewer and fewer protections 
    governing how that data is tracked, stored, and used. We are committed to calling on companies to do their 
    part to secure our data, and by the end of 2017, we pledge to take meaningful steps to protect our information 
    with vetted, secure tools.

    For companies that take the pledge: As technology companies, you recognize that you have a key role to play. You 
    decide how the services you build collect, capture, and share our data. In 20187, companies that sign this pledge 
    are committing to protecting their users’ data from exploitation and securing their users’ human rightsensuring 
    their products and services do not put human rights at risk by agreeing to:

</p>
<ul class="pledged">
<span></span>

<li> <span class="number">1</span>**Ensure Users Have Control over Their Data:** Companies must commit to meaningful 
    transparency, including by publishing clear guidance on what information is available to whom, and requiring opt-in 
  consent for the sale of information about them. Users must be individually notified if their information has been 
  compromised, including use that is inconsistent with what the user has opted into, by a third party or by a government. 
  For instance, Facebook can only satisfy this pledge if the company notifies all 50 million or so users whose information 
  was reportedly transferred to Cambridge Analytica.) When users stop using a service, they should have the option to take 
  their data with them.</li>

<li><span class="number">2</span>**Protect Our Conversations:** We use the Internet to communicate nearly everything, from 
  sensitive banking information to political debates. Offer publicly accessible and auditable end-to-end encryption, by 
  default wherever possible.
</li> 

<li><span class="number">3</span>**Protect and Limit the Data You Collect:** Data can last forever and harm people in 
  unpredictable ways. The best way to guard against that harm is to not collect or store it. Review your data collection 
  practices, and stop collecting and storing information that isn't necessary for your product or business. Commit to not 
  requesting information about your customers’ and employees’ immigration status, national origin, nationality, or 
  religion, unless required by law or strictly necessary for the service being provided. Do not provide this sensitive 
  information to the public or government officials unless required by a court order and challenge court orders that put 
  rights at risk. By default, data that is not necessary for business practices should be purged immediately. If data is 
  retained, customers should be clearly informed and have to opt-in to retention, sharing, or use of information.
</li>

<li><span class="number">4</span>**Protect Our Devices:** If our laptops, phones, and Internet-connected devices get hacked, 
  our rights are put at risk. This risk increases when gadget and phone makers endanger their customers by failing to update 
  connected devices to guard against evolving security threats. Commit to providing updates to your products when necessary, 
  and notifying customers in the case of breach or identified vulnerabilities. When other companies you work with fail to 
  keep devices updated, proactively warn users and potential buyers about them.
</li>
  
<li><span class="number">4</span>**Block overly broad corporate and government access:** Prohibit the use of your products 
  and services, especially your APIs, to collect information about your customers and users for corporate exploitation and 
  governmental surveillance purposes. Pledge to fight overly broad, questionable, and illegal efforts to surveil your users, 
  in the courts and in public. Publish your policies on what information you offer to third parties and transparency reports
  detailing requests from governments to the greatest extent allowed by law. Provide notice to individual customers or users 
  whose records are sought or obtained by the government unless barred from doing so. Commit to not voluntarily providing 
  customer information to the government, unless clearly necessary in an emergency to safeguard life. Commit to advocating 
  for reform of national security surveillance authorities, including by urging reform of laws and policies that allow for 
  mass surveillance. Support reforms that require a warrant before the government can demand content, location, and other 
  sensitive data from companies. Support immigration policies that ensure immigrants (including your own employees) are 
  treated humanely, receive due process, and are not discriminated against through travel bans.
 </li>
  </ul>

<p>In 2018, we will be working with Internet users and employees across the tech industry to urge your companies to take 
  this pledge. Over the course of 2018, we will celebrate those companies that have taken these steps and draw public 
  awareness to those that have left us vulnerable.
